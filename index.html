    <!--First Design-->
        <section class="carp-p" id="carp-p1">
            <h1>Bristol Balloon Festival 2023 - First Design</h1>
            <p>My first design was centred on the logo with a central divider following the diagonal within the logo. One side of the logo was a collage of images pulled from the True/False website and the other was red white-space matching the logo. <br><br>
            I chose the three colours used on the logo to use as my colour scheme for all four designs to create visual consistency within each poster. In addition, I chose the font ‘Impact’ as it had a very bold and easy to read style – perfect for a poster to make text stand out better. <br><br>
            For the text, the white on red has a much stronger contrast than black on red making it more visually interesting and easier to read – where there is text on the collage, I added black text with a white stroke as I found this has the best contrast. <br><br>
            I tried to align the text with the central divider – some of it laying diagonally on the line and with the text on the white-space its margin is aligned diagonally with the line. <br><br>
            While this design is relatively weak on repetition and proximity, the collage of images provides a repetitive theme and a neat proximity along with the repeated colour palette.

            <h1>Bristol Balloon Festival 2023 - Second Design</h1>
            <p>For my second design I kept most elements from the first, but I used a horizontal style making better use of white-space and to provide better readability. I once again used a collage of images but this time the entire background is part of it with the text sitting on shaded black boxes to be become more readable.</p>
        </section>

    <!--Third Section-->
        <section class="carp-p" id="carp-p3">
            <h1>Bristol Balloon Festival 2023 - Second Design</h1>            <p>My personal favourite of the three initial designs was the third where I began where experimenting with the typographic systems below - I took a semi modular approach to the text with red dividers between the different sections adding more overall flow to the poster.
            <br><br>
            I also divided the poster horizontally into the rule of thirds with the logo centred in the top third with one bright image as the background to bring more light and clarity to the top section. In the lower two thirds I used the shade of black featured in the logo as the background with white and red text bringing a lot of striking contrast to the piece.
